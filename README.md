# FloppyEMU Case Model

This is a FloppyEMU case modelled after the Apple 800k External Floppy Disk Drive.

There are 2 versions of the top case. I wired a custom cable for mine, so I could plug in the FloppyEMU using an Apple DB19 cable. I wanted it to look like a finished product, but this is not practical for most people. The version you'll likely want is the Top (IDC20 Ribbon Connector).

You'll need a microSD card extension (I got mine from Amazon for cheap)

I used magnets 5mm in diameter and 2mm tall.

*I've modified the bottom plate to fit the standard IDC20 ribbon cable the FloppyEMU comes with and most people will likely be using. For my original project, and the project in the photo I rewired an Apple Floppy Disk Drive cable so I could use a DB19 connector instead.*
