# FloppyEMU Case Model

This is a FloppyEMU case modelled after the Apple 800k External Floppy Disk Drive.

I've modified the model to fit the standard IDC20 ribbon cable that comes with the FloppyEMU. My original model was designed for an Apple Disk Drive DB19 floppy cable that I rewired, but I don't think that would be very useful for everyone else, so the model has been modified, but the step file is there for any modifications that you want to make.

You'll need a microSD card extension (I got mine from Amazon for cheap)

I used magnets 5mm in diameter and 2mm tall.

You'll need some breadboard wires to extend the LCD.

You'll need a breakout board with 3 buttons to wire the front buttons to.

I plastic welded my LCD and the breakout board in place, but the model could easily be modified to include clips on top of the pegs to hold everything in place, or UV glue would work the same.
