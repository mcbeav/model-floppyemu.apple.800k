# FloppyEMU Case Model

This is a FloppyEMU case modelled after the Apple 800k External Floppy Disk Drive.

There are 2 versions of the top case. I wired a custom cable for mine, so I could plug in the FloppyEMU using an Apple DB19 cable. I wanted it to look like a finished product, but this is not practical for most people. The version you'll likely want is the Top (IDC20 Ribbon Connector).

You'll need a microSD card extension (I got mine from Amazon for cheap)

I used magnets 5mm in diameter and 2mm tall.

You'll need some breadboard wires to extend the LCD.

You'll need a breakout board with 3 buttons to wire the front buttons to.

I plastic welded my LCD and the breakout board in place, but the model could easily be modified to include clips on top of the pegs to hold everything in place, or UV glue would work the same.
