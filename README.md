# FloppyEMU Case Model

This is a FloppyEMU case modelled after the Apple 800k External Floppy Disk Drive.

There are 2 versions of the top case. I wired a custom cable for mine, so I could plug in the FloppyEMU using an Apple DB19 cable. I wanted it to look like a finished product, but this is not practical for most people. The version you'll likely want is the Top (IDC20 Ribbon Connector).

You'll need a microSD card extension (I got mine from Amazon for cheap)

I used magnets 5mm in diameter and 2mm tall.
